üöó 4-Wheel Robotic Car with Dual Mode Operation

This project is a 4-wheel robotic car built using an ATmega32 microcontroller, capable of operating in two modes:

Autonomous Line Follower ‚Äì Uses IR sensors to follow a track.

Manual Bluetooth Control ‚Äì Controlled wirelessly via smartphone using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

The car also features obstacle avoidance using an ultrasonic sensor and servo-controlled steering for smooth movement.


‚ö° Features

Dual operating modes: Autonomous & Manual

Line-following using 2 IR sensors

Manual Bluetooth control via HC-05 module

Obstacle avoidance within 10 cm using an ultrasonic sensor

Servo motor steering for front wheels

Motor speed up to 450 RPM

Powered by a 12V supply


üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Components

ATmega32 microcontroller

L298N Motor Driver

2x IR Sensors

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Servo Motor for steering

4 DC Motors with yellow wheels

12V Battery



üîß How It Works

Autonomous Mode:

IR sensors detect the track and adjust steering accordingly.

Ultrasonic sensor stops the car if an obstacle is closer than 10 cm.

Manual Mode:

Controlled via smartphone Bluetooth app (forward, reverse, left, right, stop).

Motor speed up to 450 RPM.
